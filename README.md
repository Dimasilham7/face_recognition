## Installation

## Usage
Running the Website

To run the website and access the interface, navigate to the website folder and run the API_output.py file using Python:

python API_output.py

This will start the server, and you can access the website interface through your browser.
Running the Raw Output

If you prefer to run the application without the website interface, you can run the face_data.py file:

python face_data.py

## Note

Please note that after saving a new face, you may need to restart the server to ensure the changes take effect. This is a known limitation of the project.
